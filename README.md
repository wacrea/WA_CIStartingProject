-- EMPTY STARTING PROJECT with CodeIgniter --

Created in november 2012. Based on CodeIgniter 2.1.3.

By Default :
	- No database.
	- .htaccess pre-configured.
	- assets helper.
	- CodeIgniter in development mode
	- HTML5 struct
	- Less integration
	- Main controller/view (home)
	- Jquery
	- main JS file /assets/javascript/main.js
	
This CI starting project is pre-configured. The based configuration is already here.

Check the .htaccess file and modify "RewriteBase" if the starting project doesn't work :).

If you want to create a 404 page, check the application/config/route.php OR create a "404_error" controller/view.
